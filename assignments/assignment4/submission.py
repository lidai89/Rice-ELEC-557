        number that's within the range of A. You should introduce any additional
        variables that you are needed. In order for our solution extractor to
        obtain the number of units, for every course that you plan to take in
        the solution, you must have a variable named (courseId, semester) (e.g.
        ('COMP182', 'Fall2013') and it's assigned value is the number of units.

        So you will have to loop over variables in the csp. But there
        are different types of variables: courses and auxiliary variables with
